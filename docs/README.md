# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

This README provides a concise summary of OctoAcme's project management processes and quick navigation to each process document in this folder.

## Project Management Processes Summary
OctoAcme uses a customer-first and iterative project management methodology. Key principles include clear ownership, regular communication, standardized workflows, proactive risk management, and a continuous improvement culture.

Projects generally follow this lifecycle:

1. **Initiation** — Create a project one-pager, identify stakeholders, and make go/no-go decisions.
2. **Planning** — Produce a work breakdown, estimate effort, maintain a backlog, record a risk register, and create a release map.
3. **Execution** — Run iterative work with daily standups, PR-driven development, progress tracking, and regular demos.
4. **Release & Deployment** — Use CI gating, formal release processes, and rollback plans.
5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement** — Hold regular reviews to collect lessons learned and track action items.
